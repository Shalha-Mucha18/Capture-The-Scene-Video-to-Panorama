# Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code and collaborate with others. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories online, enabling collaboration, version control, and code sharing.

## Example Code

**Clone a repository from GitHub:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
